## 🛠️ Short-term Goals
- Add a dashboard to the home page showing:
  - Current balance
  - Last 5 transactions
  - Summary of expenses by category
- Improve form design with better validation (e.g., date pickers, clearer input instructions)

## 📈 Medium-term Goals
- Allow users to customize categories (add/delete their own)
- Add filtering options on the transaction history page
- Allow editing and deleting of individual transactions
- Improve recurring rule handling with smarter skipping/matching logic

## 🌍 Long-term / Stretch Goals
- Deploy project publicly using Render, Heroku, or AWS
- Add a mobile-responsive UI using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS
- Implement optional email reminders for upcoming expenses
- Add user profile management (update password, delete account)
- Export transactions to CSV
